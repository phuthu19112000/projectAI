    "## Point Operators\n",
    "- Pixel transforms\n",
    "    - Two commonly used point processes are multiplication and addition with a constant: g(x) = af(x) + b. The parameters a > 0 and b are often called the gain and bias parameters; sometimes these parameters are said to control contrast and brightness, respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Another commonly used dyadic (two-input) operator is the linear blend operator, g(x)=(1−α)f0(x)+αf1(x). By varying α from 0 ! 1, this operator can be used to perform a temporal cross-dissolve between two images or videos\n",
    "\n",
    "- Color transforms\n",
    "    - Adding the same value to each color channel not only increases the apparent intensity of each pixel, it can also affect the pixel’s hue and saturation. Chromaticity coordinates or even simpler color ratios can first be computed and then used after manipulating (e.g., brightening) the luminance Y to re-compute a valid RGB image with the same hue and saturation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compositing and matting\n",
    "    - The process of extracting the object from the original image is often called matting, while the process of inserting it into another image (without visible artifacts) is called compositing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The intermediate representation used for the foreground object between these two stages is called an alpha-matted color image. In addition to the three color RGB channels, an alpha-matted image contains a fourth alpha channel α (or A) that describes the relative amount of opacity or fractional coverage at each pixel. The opacity is the opposite of the transparency. Pixels within the object are fully opaque (α = 1), while pixels fully outside the object are transparent (α = 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - To composite a new (or foreground) image on top of an old (background) image: C = (1 − α)B + αF. This operator attenuates the influence of the background image B by a factor (1 − α) and then adds in the color (and opacity) values corresponding to the foreground layer F\n",
    "\n",
    "- Histogram equalization: we could simultaneously brighten some dark values and darken some light values, while still using the full extent of the available dynamic range. One popular answer to this question is to perform histogram equalization, i.e., to find an intensity mapping function f(I) such that the resulting histogram is flat\n",
    "    - Locally adaptive histogram equalization: While global histogram equalization can be useful, for some images it might be preferable to apply different kinds of equalization in different regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear filtering\n",
    "- In addition to performing local tone adjustment, neighborhood operators can be used to filter images to add soft blur, sharpen details, accentuate edges, or remove noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separable filtering: The process of performing a convolution requires K2 (multiply-add) operations per pixel, where K is the size (width or height) of the convolution kernel. In many cases, this operation can be significantly sped up by first performing a one-dimensional horizontal convolution followed by a one-dimensional vertical convolution, which requires a total of 2K operations per pixel. A convolution kernel for which this is possible is said to be separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Band-pass and steerable filters: The Sobel and corner operators are simple examples of band-pass and oriented filters. More sophisticated kernels can be created by first smoothing the image with a (unit area) Gaussian filter, and then taking the first or second derivatives. Such filters are known collectively as band-pass filters, since they filter out both low and high frequencies.\n",
    "    - Steerable filters are often used to construct both feature descriptors and edge detectors\n",
    "\n",
    "## More neighborhood operators\n",
    "\n",
    "- The filters we have looked at so far have all been linear, i.e., their response to a sum of two\n",
    "signals is the same as the sum of the individual responses. This is equivalent to saying that\n",
    "each output pixel is a weighted summation of some number of input pixels. In many cases, however, better performance can be obtained by using a non-linear combination of neighboring pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Median filtering: A better filter to use in this case is the median filter, which selects the median value from each pixel’s neighborhood. Since the shot noise value usually lies well outside the true values in the neighborhood, the median filter is able to filter away such bad pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binary image processing: While non-linear filters are often used to enhance grayscale and color images, they are also used extensively to process binary images.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Morphology: The standard operations used in binary morphology include: dilation, erosion, majority, opening, closing. This is a handy tool to have around whenever you need to clean up some thresholded images\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Distance transforms: is useful in quickly precomputing the distance to a curve or set of points using a two-pass raster algorithm. A useful extension of the basic distance transform is the signed distance transform, which computes distances to boundary pixels for all the pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Connected components: Another useful semi-global image operation is finding connected components, which are defined as regions of adjacent pixels that have the same input value or label.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Pixels are said to be N4 adjacent if they are immediately horizontally or vertically adjacent, and N8 if they can also be diagonally adjacent.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Both variants of connected components are widely used in a variety of applications, such as finding individual letters in a scanned document or finding objects (say, cells) in a thresholded image and computing their area statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fourier transforms: Common application of image processing is the enhancement of images through the use of sharpening and noise removal operations, which require some kind of neighborhood\n",
    "processing.\n",
    "    - Traditionally, these kinds of operations were performed using linear filtering\n",
    "    - Today, it is more common to use non-linear filters , such as the weighted median or bilateral filter, anisotropic diffusion or non-local means\n",
    "    - When measuring the effectiveness of image denoising algorithms, it is common to report the results as a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) measurement\n",
    "    - A better way to measure the quality is to use a perceptually based similarity metric, such as the structural similarity (SSIM) index or FLIP image difference evaluator\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pyramids and wavelets\n",
    "    - Interpolation: In order to interpolate (or upsample) an image to a higher resolution, we need to select some interpolation kernel with which to convolve the image\n",
    "        - What kinds of kernel make good interpolators? The answer depends on the application and the computation time involved.\n",
    "        - The highest quality interpolator is generally believed to be the windowed sinc function because it both preserves details in the lower resolution image and avoids aliasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Decimation: decimation (downsampling) is required to reduce the resolution\n",
    "        - To perform decimation, we first (conceptually) convolve the image with a low-pass filter (to avoid aliasing) and then keep every rth sample.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Multi-resolution representations:\n",
    "        ![](./images/i2.png)\n",
    "        - pyramids can be used to accelerate coarse-to-fine search algorithms, to look for objects or patterns at different scales, and to perform multi-resolution blending operations\n",
    "        - There are two kinds of Image Pyramids. 1) Gaussian Pyramid and 2) Laplacian Pyramids\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Wavelets: While pyramids are used extensively in computer vision applications, some people use wavelet decompositions as an alternative\n",
    "        - Wavelets provide a smooth way to decompose a signal into frequency components without blocking and are closely related to pyramids.\n",
    "        - As both image pyramids and wavelets decompose an image into multi-resolution descriptions that are localized in both space and frequency, how do they differ?\n",
    "            - The usual answer is that traditional pyramids are overcomplete, they use more pixels than the original image to represent the decomposition, whereas wavelets provide a tight frame, they keep the size of the decomposition the same as the image \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Application: Image blending\n",
    "        - One of the most engaging and fun applications of the Laplacian pyramid is the creation of blended composite images\n",
    "        - The key to their approach is that the low-frequency color variations between the red apple and the orange are smoothly blended, while the higher-frequency textures on each fruit are blended more quickly to avoid “ghosting” effects when two textures are overlaid.\n",
    "        - To create the blended image:\n",
    "            -  each source image is first decomposed into its own Laplacian pyramid\n",
    "            -  Each band is then multiplied by a smooth weighting function whose extent is proportional to the pyramid level. The simplest and most general way to create these weights is to take a binary mask image and to construct a Gaussian pyramid from this mask\n",
    "            - Each Laplacian pyramid image is then multiplied by its corresponding Gaussian mask and the sum of these two weighted pyramids is then used to construct the final image\n",
    "\n",
    "- Geometric transformations\n",
    "    - Parametric transformations: Such a transformation is called parametric because it is controlled by a small number of parameters\n",
    "        ![](./images/i3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Parametric transformations apply a global deformation to an image, where the behavior of the transformation is controlled by a small number of parameters\n",
    "        ![](./images/i4.png)\n",
    "        - Where does the function h^(x0) come from? Quite often, it can simply be computed as the inverse of h(x), all of the parametric transforms listed in Table 3.3 have closed form solutions for the inverse transform: simply take the inverse of the 3 × 3 matrix specifying the transform.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Mesh-based warping: While parametric transforms specified by a small number of global parameters have many uses, local deformations with more degrees of freedom are often required. To perform such a transformation, different amounts of motion are required in different parts of the image\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The first approach, is to specify a sparse set of corresponding points. The displacement of these points can then be interpolated to a dense displacement field\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Alternative methods for interpolating a sparse set of displacements include moving nearby quadrilateral mesh vertices using variational (energy minimizing) interpolants such as regularization or using locally weighted (radial basis function) combinations of displacements \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Application: Feature-based morphing\n",
    "        - While warps can be used to change the appearance of or to animate a single image, even more powerful effects can be obtained by warping and blending two or more images using a process now commonly known as morphing"
