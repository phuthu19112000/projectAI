    "- To estimate the motion between two or more images, a suitable error metric must first be chosen to compare the images (Section 9.1). Once this has been established, a suitable search technique must be devised. The simplest technique is to exhaustively try all possible alignments, i.e., to do a full search. In practice, this may be too slow, so hierarchical coarse-to-fine techniques (Section 9.1.1) based on image pyramids are normally used. Alternatively, Fourier transforms (Section 9.1.2) can be used to speed up the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To get sub-pixel precision in the alignment, incremental methods (Section 9.1.3) based on a Taylor series expansion of the image function are often used. Motion estimation can be made more reliable by learning the typical dynamics or motion statistics of the scenes or objects being tracked\n",
    "\n",
    "- For more complex motions, piecewise parametric spline motion models (Section 9.2.2) can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the presence of multiple independent (and perhaps non-rigid) motions, general-purpose optical flow techniques need to be used. For even more complex motions that include a lot of occlusions, layered motion models (Section 9.4), which decompose the scene into coherently moving layers, can work well.\n",

    "    - The error metrics above ignore that fact that for a given alignment, some of the pixels being compared may lie outside the original image boundaries. Furthermore, we may want to partially or completely downweight the contributions of certain pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - All of these tasks can be accomplished by associating a spatially varying per-pixel weight with each of the two images being matched\n",
